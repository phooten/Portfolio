These are some projects I've been able to collect visuals for that I've worked on. This is meant to give a better idea of the projects,
rather than just a description. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!



## Robotics:
These robots were built with a Clemson University Team to complete in an obsticle course for the [SoutheastCon](https://attend.ieee.org/southeastcon-2021/) 
competition in 2019 and 2018. I unfortunatley don't have any videos of the prior years. 
*2019 was a much better outcome than 2018. If you had to pick one to watch, watch 2019
