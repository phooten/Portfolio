# Projects
These are some projects I've been able to collect visuals for that I've worked on. This is meant to give a better idea of the projects,
rather than just a description. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!


## Robotics:
These robots were built with a Clemson University Team to complete in an obsticle course for the [SoutheastCon](https://attend.ieee.org/southeastcon-2021/) 
competition in 2019 and 2018. The control was done completely by onboard sensors, batteries, and microcontroller. I don't have any videos of the prior years. 
*2019 was a much better outcome than 2018. If you had to pick one to watch, watch 2019 

[2019 Robot Demo [ Youtube ] ](https://youtu.be/v7Fcc2j_vHM)
* Brief Objective Description:
    * Collect colored cubes and spheres, then sort them on the robot
    * Place the objects in the correct squares that are in the corners of the board [ not done in the video ]
    * Bonus points for each lap around the board

[2018 Robot Demo [ Youtube ] ](https://youtu.be/KLXMmuJMLeM)
* Brief Objective Description:
    * Receive the order to press the buttons, switches, and turn the steering wheel. This was received via binary code from an infrared LED
    * Press the two buttons, them move down and press the two switches, both in the correct order
    * Rotate the wheel to the correct angle [ Not done successfully in the video ]
    * Pick up the metal box via electromagnet [ Not done successfully in the video ]

## GitHub
[ Random Image Generator - In Progress](https://github.com/phooten/imageGenerator.git)
* End Goal: 
   * Allow a user to upload photos which will generate a random texture to be wrapped around a virtual 3D object.
* Current Status:
   *  A single image can be wrapped around an object
   *  Next steps are to create a GUI so a user can upload their own photos without messing with code
   * Sample image:
